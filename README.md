# [Hearthstone Stats](https://www.leannethng.com/hearthstone_stats)

Displaying my data from the game [Hearthstone](https://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/).

Using [track-o-bot](https://trackobot.com) to track my stats and loading the json with AJAX and jQuery.

To do:

- Design the style and layout of site now that the data etc is all working
- Style the win/loss buttons
- Make the site responsive
- add tooltips for hover over the graph columns

Done:

- ~~Add average win rate~~
- ~~Add in the 'time game was played' column in History section~~
